# Receipt enhancement ðŸ“‘
Modification of the observation of a receipt using computer vision and geometric operations that include:
- Adaptative thresholding
- Contouring and filtering
- Homography
- Contour analysis and sorting
- Thin plate spline

# Notes and blog ðŸ“š
These operation are tuned to work on specific conditions (background mainly) and will not work if used in unrelated conditions. 
I blured some parts of the receipt data since they contain information that can be used for identification.

# To do ðŸ› 
- Enhancement of the thresholding to be more robust to background / lightening.
- Non linear grid construction for TPS operation.
