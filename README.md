# Receipt enhancement
Modification of the observation of a receipt using computer vision and geometric operations that include:
- Adaptative thresholding
- Contouring and filtering
- Homography
- Contour analysis and sorting
- Thin plate spline

These operation are tuned to work on specific conditions (background mainly) and will not work if used in unrelated conditions. 
I blured some parts of the receipt data since they contain information that can be used for identification.
