Modification of the observation of a receipt using computer vision and geometric operations.

They include among other:
- Adaptative thresholding
- Contouring and filtering
- Homography
- Contour analysis and sorting
- Thin plate spline

These operation are tuned to work on specific conditions (background mainly) and will not work if used in unrelated conditions.
